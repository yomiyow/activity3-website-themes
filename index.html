      <section>
        <p>When I was six years old I broke my leg</p>
        <p>I was running from my brother and his friends</p>
        <p>And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down</p>
        <p>I was younger then</p>
        <p>Take me back to when</p>
      </section>

      <section class="favorite-verse">
        <p>I found my heart and broke it here</p>
        <p>Made friends and lost them through the years</p>
        <p>And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long</p>
        <p>I know I've grown</p>
        <p>But I can't wait to go home</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>I'm on my way</p>
        <p>Driving at 90 down those country lanes</p>
        <p>Singing to "Tiny Dancer"</p>
        <p>And I miss the way</p>
        <p>You make me feel</p>
        <p>And it's real</p>
        <p>When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes</p>
        <p>Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends</p>
        <p>Had my first kiss on a Friday night</p>
        <p>I don't reckon that I did it right</p>

        <p>We found weekend jobs, when we got paid</p>
        <p>We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight</p>
        <p>Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long</p>
        <p>Oh, how we've grown</p>
        <p>But I can't wait to go home</p>

        <p>One friend left to sell clothes</p>
        <p>One works down by the coast</p>
        <p>One had two kids but lives alone</p>
        <p>One's brother overdosed</p>
        <p>One's already on his second wife</p>
        <p>One's just barely getting by</p>
        <p>But these people raised me</p>
        <p>And I can't wait to go home</p>

        <p>And I'm on my way</p>
        <p>I still remember these old country lanes</p>
        <p>When we did not know the answers</p>
        <p>And I miss the way</p>
        <p>You make me feel</p>
        <p>And it's real</p>
